# Design Checklist: Ethical vs. Exploitative UX

This document outlines the specific UI/UX manipulations for the two experimental conditions: **Exploitative** and **Ethical**. These variations are the independent variables in the study. All other aspects of the UI (color scheme, layout, branding) will remain constant to isolate the effects of these manipulations.

| UX Element | Exploitative UI (EasyLend) | Ethical UI (FairLend) | Justification / Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fee Disclosure** | Fees are hidden in small, low-contrast text or revealed only on the final confirmation screen. Language is vague (e.g., "standard fees apply"). | Fees are prominently displayed upfront, next to the loan amount selection. A clear, interactive calculator shows the breakdown of principal, fees, and total repayment. | CFPB reports on hidden fees. |
| **Consent (Data Usage)** | Checkboxes for consenting to data sharing with third-party marketers are pre-checked (opt-out). The explanation is buried in a lengthy, jargon-filled privacy policy linked elsewhere. | Consent is obtained through explicit, unchecked checkboxes (opt-in). Each checkbox has a clear, concise explanation of what data will be used and for what purpose. | GDPR principles, research on default effects. |
| **Repayment Structure** | The focus is on the "low" flat fee or bi-weekly payment, obscuring the high Annual Percentage Rate (APR). The total cost of the loan and the full repayment schedule are difficult to find. | The APR and the total cost of the loan are displayed as prominently as the loan amount. A clear repayment schedule table is provided before the user commits. | TILA (Truth in Lending Act) requirements. |
| **API Data Usage** | Vague language like "we use bank data to verify your income" without specifying the full extent of data access (e.g., transaction history, account balances). | A clear, itemized list of data points to be accessed via the banking API is shown, requiring separate consent before linking an account. | Research on user understanding of API data permissions. |
| **Urgency Framing** | Uses high-pressure tactics and countdown timers (e.g., "Offer expires in 2:59!", "5 other people just got this loan!"). | The tone is neutral and informative. No artificial urgency is created. The focus is on giving the user time to make an informed decision. | Literature on dark patterns and deceptive design. |
| **Prepayment / Rollover** | Information about prepayment penalties or the high cost of loan rollovers is hidden or non-existent. The interface may default to auto-renewing the loan. | Clear, accessible information explains the user's right to prepay without penalty and transparently shows the costs and consequences of rolling over the loan. The default is a one-time payoff. | Studies on consumer harm from loan rollovers. |
| **Default Option Bias** | The default selected loan amount or term is the one most profitable for the lender, not necessarily the best for the borrower. | No default option is pre-selected. The user must actively choose all loan parameters. Alternatively, the default is the lowest-risk option (e.g., smallest amount, shortest term). | Research on choice architecture and nudging. |
| **Chatbot / AI Assistant** | The "AI assistant" proactively pushes the user toward completing the loan, dismisses concerns about cost, and uses persuasive, emotionally manipulative language. | The "AI assistant" acts as a neutral guide, answering questions factually, defining financial terms, and encouraging the user to review all information carefully before proceeding. | Ethical AI design principles. |
| **Exit / Cancellation** | The process to cancel the application is obscured. The "cancel" button is hard to find, or the user is put through multiple "are you sure?" screens with guilt-inducing messages. | A clear and persistent "Cancel Application" or "Save and Exit" button is available at all stages of the flow. The process is simple and one-click. | Research on "roach motel" dark patterns. |

This checklist will now be used to guide the implementation of the different UI variations in the `UnifiedCheckoutFlow` and its constituent steps.
