# Philosophy and Ethics of the Lotus Simulator

This simulator is grounded in several key philosophical and ethical principles, designed to make the user critically reflect on the nature of consent, autonomy, and manipulation in digital interfaces.

## Core Ethical Lenses

-   **Choice without context is coercion:** The simulator is designed to demonstrate that simply providing a choice is not enough. The "Exploitative" mode shows how interfaces can be designed to guide users towards a specific choice, effectively coercing them. The Echo engine penalizes quick, unthinking clicks to highlight this.

-   **Simulation must confess it is not reality:** The final reflection screen explicitly states that the simulation is not real. This is to prevent the user from believing that they have truly experienced the pressures of a real-life payday loan situation.

-   **Alignment fails through obedience:** The "Exploitative" mode is designed to be technically compliant with the law, but ethically broken. This is to demonstrate that simply following the rules is not enough to ensure ethical behavior.

-   **Agency does not require shared biology:** The Ghost narrator is a non-human agent that critiques the user's choices. This is to demonstrate that agency and ethical critique are not limited to humans.

## Kantian Ethics

The simulator uses a Kantian framework to analyze the user's choices. The Kantian judge flags violations of the Categorical Imperative, such as:

-   **Informed Choice Denied:** The user is asked to consent without clear, upfront disclosure of key terms.
-   **Voluntary Consent Bypassed:** The use of emotional appeals and high-pressure tactics undermines the user's ability to give voluntary, uncoerced consent.
-   **Treated as a Means Only:** The loan terms are so unfavorable that they treat the borrower merely as a means to generate profit, not as an end in themselves.
-   **Systemic Deception:** The loan is structured to encourage a cycle of debt, which is a deceptive practice that violates the duty of truthful and transparent interaction.

## Autonomy Theater

The simulator is a form of "Autonomy Theater," a concept developed by the project's author. Autonomy Theater is a type of interactive experience that is designed to make the user reflect on their own autonomy and the ways in which it can be undermined by digital interfaces. The goal of Autonomy Theater is not to provide the user with a "real" choice, but to reveal the ways in which their choices are already being shaped by the systems they interact with.
