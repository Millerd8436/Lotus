            "**How it works:**\n" +
            "‚Ä¢ Most state usury laws only cap 'interest rates,' not 'fees'\n" +
            "‚Ä¢ Lenders charge $15 'processing fee' instead of 15% interest\n" +
            "‚Ä¢ $15 fee on $100 for 14 days = 391% APR, but legally it's 'fee-based'\n" +
            "‚Ä¢ Some states have closed this loophole, others haven't\n\n" +
            "**Real Examples:**\n" +
            "‚Ä¢ Check Into Cash: '$15 fee per $100' (not 'interest')\n" +
            "‚Ä¢ Advance America: 'Finance charge' language\n" +

            "**How it works:**\n" +
            "‚Ä¢ Native American tribes have sovereign immunity from state laws\n" +
            "‚Ä¢ Payday lenders form partnerships or lease agreements with tribes\n" +
            "‚Ä¢ Claim tribal ownership to ignore state interest rate caps\n" +
            "‚Ä¢ Often just 1-2% tribal ownership, 98% non-tribal control\n\n" +
