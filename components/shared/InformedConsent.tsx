              </p>
              <p>
                This research aims to understand how different interface designs and presentation styles 
                affect people's comprehension of loan terms, costs, and risks. We are studying various 
                types of short-term financial products including payday loans, installment loans, 
                earned wage advances, and buy-now-pay-later services.

                <strong>Why have I been invited?</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                You have been invited because you are an adult who might encounter these types of 
                financial products online. We are seeking participants from diverse backgrounds to 
                understand how different people interact with these loan interfaces.

                <strong>What will the results be used for?</strong>

                The results may be used for academic research, policy recommendations, and to inform 
                better design practices for financial products. Findings may be published in academic 
                journals or presented at conferences, but your individual responses will remain anonymous.
