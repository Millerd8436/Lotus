## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. Create GitHub Repository

```bash
# Initialize git repository (if not already done)
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Initial commit: Complete Lotus payday lending simulation"

# Add GitHub remote (replace with your repository URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/lotus-simulation.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### 2. Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click **Settings** tab
