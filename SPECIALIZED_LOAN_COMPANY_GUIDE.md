# Specialized Loan Company UX Flows: Research-Based Implementation Guide

## Overview

This implementation creates four scientifically valid loan simulators that mirror the actual UX patterns, deceptive practices, and interface designs of the top real-world loan companies. Each simulator is based on extensive 2025 web research and preserves ecological validity while eliminating experimental bias.

## Research Methodology

### Web Research Sources (2025)
- **CashNetUSA**: Customer reviews, rate disclosures, actual UI patterns
- **Earnin/DailyPay**: App interfaces, tip mechanisms, employer partnerships
- **Klarna/Affirm**: Checkout flows, late fee structures, "0% interest" messaging
- **OppFi/Rise**: Installment loan terms, monthly payment anchoring, total cost hiding

### Scientific Validity Framework
Each simulator maintains:
- **Ecological Validity**: Authentic real-world interface replication
- **Construct Validity**: Accurate measurement of intended variables
- **External Validity**: Generalizable to actual loan experiences
- **Elimination of Priming**: No artificial ethical/exploitative labels

## Implemented Loan Company Simulators

### 1. CashNetUSA Payday Loan Flow

**Company Profile**: Since 2005, 4M+ customers, 160-1171% APR range

**Authentic UX Patterns Implemented**:
- Cluttered interface with multiple trust badges
- Hidden APR in small text/modal windows
- Aggressive urgency timers and "Limited Time" messaging
- Pre-selected marketing checkboxes
- Rollover/extension options buried in fine print
- Multiple call-to-action buttons creating decision fatigue

**Key Deceptive Mechanisms**:
- APR disclosure requires multiple clicks to access
- Rollover fees (25% of loan amount) hidden until needed
- Time pressure tactics with countdown timers
- Emergency scenario framing ("Save your car from repo")

**Data Collection Points**:

- Employer verification and "partnership" messaging
- Default tip amounts pre-selected ($3-5 range)
- Difficult tip opt-out process requiring extra clicks
- "Optional" tip with social pressure messaging
- Bank data sharing consent with vague language

**Key Deceptive Mechanisms**:
- Tips presented as "voluntary" but pre-selected and socially pressured
- "0% APR" messaging while effective rates can reach 300%+ via tips

**Authentic UX Patterns Implemented**:
- Heavy emphasis on low monthly payments ($394/month for $2000)
- Total cost information hidden behind "Show details" links
- Term length manipulation (18 months as "Most Popular")
- Credit building messaging to justify high costs
- Trust badges and "affordable payment" framing

**Key Deceptive Mechanisms**:
- Monthly payment anchoring ($394 vs. $3,500 total cost)
- Total repayment amount requiring extra clicks to view
- APR disclosure in small text
- "Build credit" messaging to justify predatory rates

**Data Collection Points**:
- Total cost detail viewing behavior
- Monthly payment vs. total cost focus patterns

- Emotional state tracking through interaction patterns
- Risk assessment based on behavioral indicators

### Dopamine Banking System
- Micro-celebration triggers for completion steps

- Reward anticipation mechanics

### Authentic Financial Messaging
- Loan-type specific regulatory disclosures
- Contextual warnings based on user behavior
- Progressive disclosure of complex terms
- State-specific legal requirements

## Scenario Prompts for Ecological Validity

### Payday Loan Scenario
"You're a full-time student working part-time. Last night, your car broke down and the repair estimate is $460. Rent is due in 4 days. Your checking balance is $73. You don't own a credit card and your next paycheck arrives in 11 days. You're searching online for fast cash options and land on a site like this."

### EWA Scenario
"You just started working at a warehouse job that pays bi-weekly. You've worked 7 days but your first paycheck won't hit for another 12. You need groceries and to cover a $90 phone bill. Your employer partners with a service that lets you 'get paid early.' There's a small 'transfer fee,' and it connects to your bank."

### BNPL Scenario
"You're starting the fall semester and browsing Amazon for textbooks. One costs $110, and your balance is only $45 after paying rent. You notice a 'Split into 4 payments of $27.50' button—no interest advertised. You've never used a service like this before. It says the first payment is today and the rest come every two weeks."

### Installment Loan Scenario
"You've missed two utility bills and a medical collection notice just hit your mailbox. You estimate needing $800 to catch up and stay current. You don't want a payday loan again—so you search for 'personal installment loans.' You find a site offering flexible payments over several months with no credit required."
