# Comprehensive Research Framework 2025: Loan UX Realism Study

## Overview

This document describes the complete research framework for studying deceptive UX patterns in financial lending products. The system implements scientifically valid loan simulators based on 2025 web research, with comprehensive behavioral tracking, specialized quizzes, and IRB-compliant consent processes.

## üéØ Research Objectives

### Primary Research Questions
1. **Comprehension Variance**: How do different loan UX patterns affect user understanding of true costs and risks?
2. **Deceptive Pattern Effectiveness**: Which specific UX elements successfully obscure important financial information?
3. **Trust vs. Understanding**: Do "cleaner" UX designs create trust illusions that mask poor comprehension?
4. **Behavioral Decision Patterns**: How do different interface designs influence user decision-making speed and thoroughness?

### Ecological Validity Approach
- **No artificial manipulation**: Each simulator reflects authentic 2025 web patterns from actual lenders
- **Real-world scenario triggers**: Pre-loan prompts based on genuine financial stress situations
- **Authentic measurement**: Quiz questions target actual deceptive patterns found in the wild
