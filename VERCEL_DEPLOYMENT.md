## ✅ Migration Complete

### Integrated Features

- **3-Phase Educational Structure**: Exploitative → Ethical → Reflection
- **Comprehensive Dark Patterns**: Time pressure, default bias, artificial scarcity, etc.
- **Autonomy Violation Tracking**: Kantian ethics analysis and psychological manipulation detection
- **State-by-State Regulations**: Real loan regulation comparison across US states
- **Advanced Loan Calculations**: APR, fees, rollover mechanics, debt cycle simulation
- **Educational Overlays**: Ghost mode revealing manipulation tactics
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Real-time coercion scoring and choice integrity tracking
- **Reflection Dashboard**: Comprehensive analysis of user experience and decision patterns

### Removed Obsolete Files

- ✅ Static `index.html` (replaced by Next.js pages)
- ✅ Legacy JavaScript files (logic integrated into React components)
- ✅ Static `public/lotus-app.js` (replaced by component architecture)
- ✅ GitHub Pages workflow (replaced by Vercel auto-deployment)
- ✅ Backup files in `_backup/` (all logic successfully integrated)

- **Lucide React**: Icon library for UI elements

### Build Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Development server
- `npm run build` - Production build
- `npm run start` - Production server
- `npm run lint` - Code linting

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### Option 1: Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Push code to GitHub repository
2. Connect repository to Vercel dashboard
3. Vercel will auto-detect Next.js and deploy
4. Custom domain can be configured in dashboard

### Option 2: Vercel CLI

```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel login
vercel --prod
```

### Option 3: Git Integration

1. Connect GitHub repo to Vercel
2. Every push to `main` branch auto-deploys
3. Pull requests get preview deployments

## 🎯 Educational Impact

This simulator provides a comprehensive educational experience:

1. **Phase 1 (Exploitative)**: Exposes users to real predatory lending tactics
2. **Phase 2 (Ethical)**: Shows transparent, ethical lending alternatives
3. **Phase 3 (Reflection)**: Analyzes manipulation tactics and educates about consumer protection

The application tracks over 15 different types of psychological manipulation and provides detailed analysis of how choice architecture affects decision-making.

## 🔍 Features Preserved from Legacy Codebase

All valuable functionality from the original 15,000+ lines of legacy code has been preserved and enhanced:

- Complex loan calculation engines
- State regulation databases
- Psychological analysis algorithms
- Dark pattern UI implementations
- Educational content and quizzes
- Real-time behavioral tracking
- Autonomy violation detection
- Coercion scoring systems

## 📈 Performance & Scalability

- **Edge Functions**: Serverless execution at edge locations
- **Automatic Scaling**: Handles traffic spikes seamlessly
- **Global CDN**: Fast content delivery worldwide
- **Build Optimization**: Next.js optimizes bundle size and performance
- **TypeScript**: Compile-time error detection and IDE support

## 🎓 Educational Compliance

The simulator maintains its educational mission while leveraging modern web technologies:

- Ethical use of dark patterns for educational purposes
- Clear educational context and reflection phases
- Consumer protection advocacy through interactive experience
- Academic research potential with behavioral data collection
